# Terminal-Twenty-One
A terminal recreation of the game Twenty One on Roblox (kinda like Blackjack) but with no trump cards. Written in C++.
Make sure you downloaded all the files! Afterwards, go into a compiler such as Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code or others, or even online ones such as OnlineGDB and upload all the files there. Make sure they are in the same folder! Simply run the program and it should work properly. If you encounter any bugs along the way, do make sure to report them to me but as far as I know there shouldn't be any left, but you never know :)
If the program happens to crash (it will happen probably a lot), just run it until it works, perhaps it's owing to the fact that it has a lot of switch cases 

Have fun with it!

If you're using Visual Studio Code, use the following command to compile the program:

```
g++ -o TerminalTwentyOne.exe alignments.cpp botdecision.cpp main.cpp showtable.cpp winner.cpp
```

And to run the program:
```
./TerminalTwentyOne.exe
```
